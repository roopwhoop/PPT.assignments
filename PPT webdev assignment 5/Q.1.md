Q.1 Whatâ€™s difference between Synchronous and Asynchronous?
Answer-

Before starting the topic difference between synchronous and asynchronous transmission, you must know about the transmission. The action of transferring data or anything from one place to other is referred to as transmission. It is a method of sharing data between two devices linked by a network, also known as communication mode. Synchronous and asynchronous transmissions are the two main types of transmission used in computer networking.

In both synchronous and asynchronous transmission, data is sent between the transmitter and the receiver based on a clock pulse utilized for synchronization. These serial data transmission techniques are both known as synchronous transmission.

In this article, you will learn about the difference between Synchronous and Asynchronous transmission. But before discussing the differences, you must know about Synchronous and Asynchronous transmission with their advantages and disadvantages
