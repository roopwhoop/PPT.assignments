Q.4 Whats difference between Inline, Inline Block and block ?
Answer-

inline- display: inline means that the element is displayed inline, inside the current block on the same line. Only when it's between two blocks does the element form an 'anonymous block', that however has the smallest possible width.

block- The display CSS property sets whether an element is treated as a block or inline element and the layout used for its children, such as flow layout, grid or flex. Formally, the display property sets an element's inner and outer display types.

Inline block- display: inline-block
An element you assign a display of inline-block is inline by presentation. But it has the added advantage of you being able to apply width and height to it, which you can't do when the element is assigned a display of inline
