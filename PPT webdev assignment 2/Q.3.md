Q.3 What is VW/VH ?
Answer-

To reiterate, VH stands for “viewport height”, which is the viewable screen's height. 100VH would represent 100% of the viewport's height, or the full height of the screen. And of course, VW stands for “viewport width”, which is the viewable screen's width.

Viewport Height (vh). This unit is based on the height of the viewport. A value of 1vh is equal to 1% of the viewport height.
Viewport Width (vw). This unit is based on the width of the viewport. A value of 1vw is equal to 1% of the viewport width.
