Q.6 Whatâ€™s z-index and How does it Function ?
Answer-

The z-index property in CSS is used to specify the stack order of an element. An element with a higher z-index value will be placed in front of an element with a lower z-index value. The value of the z-index property is an integer, the element with a higher number is placed on top of the elements with lower numbers.
Z Index ( z-index ) is a CSS property that defines the order of overlapping HTML elements. Elements with a higher index will be placed on top of elements with a lower index. Note: Z index only works on positioned elements ( position:absolute , position:relative , or position:fixed ).
