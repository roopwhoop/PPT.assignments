Q.10 What is the purpose of the spread operator (...) in ES6?
Answer-

ES6 introduced a new operator referred to as a spread operator, which consists of three dots (...). It allows an iterable to expand in places where more than zero arguments are expected. It gives us the privilege to obtain the parameters from an array.

Spread operator syntax is similar to the rest parameter, but it is entirely opposite of it. Let's understand the syntax of the spread operator.

Syntax
var variablename1 = [...value];  
The three dots (...) in the above syntax are the spread operator, which targets the entire values in the particular variable.
