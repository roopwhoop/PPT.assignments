Q.6  What is template literals in ES6 and how do you use them?
Answer-

Template literals came with ES6 (ECMAScript6) and is one of the best features ES6 has to offer. But why should you use it and what makes it better than its alternative? In this article we will explore what template literals are, their advantages and why it is superior than JavaScript’s common alternatives when dealing with strings.

emplate literals, also known as template strings, are a new-ish feature in JavaScript that allow you to create string literals with embedded expressions. They are surrounded by the backtick (` `) characters, rather than the single or double quotes used for regular string literals, and use placeholders, indicated with a dollar sign and curly braces (${expression}`), to embed expressions within the string.

Here is an example of a template literal:

const name = 'John';
console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`); // Outputs: "Hello, John!"

--Template literals offer several benefits over traditional string concatenation:

1.Improved readability: Template literals are easier to read and write than traditional string concatenation, especially for long strings or strings with multiple embedded expressions.

2.Multiline support: Template literals can span multiple lines, making it easier to create multi-line strings without the need for line breaks or string concatenation.

3.Expressions: Template literals can include expressions within them, which are evaluated and the result is included in the string. This allows you to easily include dynamic content in your strings.

4.Tagged template literals: Template literals can be “tagged” with a function, which allows you to pre-process the string before the output. This can be useful for tasks such as internationalization (i18n) or string formatting.
