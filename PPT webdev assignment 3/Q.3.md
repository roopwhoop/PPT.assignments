Q.3 Explain the concept of Breakpoints in Responsive Web Design and How They are used in Media Queries.
Answer-

A breakpoint in a responsive design is the “point” at which a website’s content and design will adapt in a certain way to provide the best possible user experience. For example, when the website of The New Yorker is viewed on a regular desktop screen, the user sees the whole navigation menu on the sidebar. However, if viewed on a mobile device screen, the smaller screen size will cause the navigation bar to appear on the top left of the screen as a menu. Check this out on our Responsive Checker.

Essentially, breakpoints are pixel values that a developer/designer can define in CSS. When a responsive website reaches those pixel values, a transformation (such as the one detailed above) occurs so that the website offers an optimal user experience.

For developers, a common breaking point is a media query.
For designers, a common breaking point is the juncture at which a change is made to how the website content or design appears to the viewer.
